Hey KSK, JKK. I know you are in same place, same team.
To remind you about last event, I am writting msg again. The purpose trying to access gitlab, slack space is very dirty.
Especially, sharing samri project (sadalearning) is very dangerous. Your dirty behavior made a serious, big problem to our team.
Because of bad you guys, all other members are removed from gitlab, slack space. It means that you pushed our team in very difficult situation. You make sense what I mean?
From my heart, I want to call you fucking guys. You should ask for forgiveness, but you never talked about it.
You are acting as dog guys. I am warning you again. If you changed repositories from public into private, you should delete whole repositories and projects.
On my side, 3 public repos are removed, but I think you kept them as private projects.
If you feel your fault really, you should share screenshots of your git profile (which 3 private repositories are removed too).
If you don't share screenshots on here, I have your photos. Guess what I can do with it.  Don't push me to do that. Got it?
If I see same event like this in future, I can't guarantee what will be back to you. but promise that you will be rewarded for what bad things you do.
If you see my msg, contact me here or on telegram (@samricore).
